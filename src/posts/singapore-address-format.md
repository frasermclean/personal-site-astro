Having recently moved to Singapore, I am having to apply for numerous accounts and
goverment services. Initially, I found the address format a bit confusing, but after
some research it makes a lot more sense now.

It turns out, there are two address formats in Singapore. One for multi-unit buildings
and another for landed homes (or single unit buildings).

## Multi-unit buildings

Given the limited availabilty of space, the majority of housing as well as business
offices in Singapore are in high-rise buildings. They all share the same address format:

```
[Block Number] [Street Name]
(Optional Building Name) #[Floor Number]-[Unit Number]
Singapore [Postal Code]
```

Here is an example:

```
11 Orchard Turn
Orchard Parksuites #01-13
Singapore 238800
```

## Landed homes (single unit buildings)

In Singapore, detached houses are generally called landed properties. Because there is no 
unit level, unit number, and building name, the second line from the address template
shown previously can be omitted completely:

```
[Unit Number] [Street Name]
Singapore [Postal Code]
```

An example for landed homes:

```
1 Orchard Boulevard
Singapore 248649
```

## Postal codes
According to this [WikiPedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Singapore),
postal codes in Singapore are 6 digits long and actually contain quite a bit of information.
The sector is represented by the first two numbers of the postal code. The remaining four numbers
define the delivery point within the sector

Given the postal code **569993**:
* **56** is the sector code
* **9933** is the delivery point (house or building).
